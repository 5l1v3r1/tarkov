# Tarkov
An unofficial client library for the [Escape from Tarkov](https://escapefromtarkov.com) (EFT) API.

## Getting Started

Comprehensive examples can be found in the `examples` directory.

### Authentication
![Authentication flowchart](https://i.imgur.com/mLwH987.png)
There are three ways to authenticate your EFT account for `tarkov`. **Your _PMC_ profile must be selected with `select_profile` before any other API can be called.**
1. [Email & password](https://docs.rs/todo)
The easiest way to authenticate your account is to login with your email & password. However, a captcha and 2FA code might be required, read the [HWID section](#hardware-id) for more details.
2. [Access token](https://docs.rs/todo)
Access token (Bearer token) can be found by sniffing EFT _launcher_ traffic.
3. [Session/`PHPSESSID`](https://docs.rs/todo)
Session is a cookie called `PHPSESSID`, it can be found by sniffing EFT _game_ traffic. HWID is tied to the session so both must be valid. Session is a 32-bit hexadecimal string.

### Hardware ID
Hardware ID (HWID) is required on authentication, it can either be sniffed from the EFT _launcher_ or [generated](https://docs.rs/todo). It's recommended to save the HWID in a _persistent store_ and reuse it after the first successful authentication.

Using a fresh HWID means both 2FA and Captcha will be triggered on your first authentication attempt. The easiest way to avoid this is to login to the EFT launcher and fetch the HWID generated by the launcher.

### Rust Version
`tarkov` has a minimum version requirement of `1.39.0` as it uses the `async_await` feature.
